A simple Emoji picker that integrates in the rich-text block toolbar.

== Description ==
Accessing the Emoji library can be painful üò´ on some operating systems. You always have to leave the editor which is not useful for distraction-free writing.
This plugin reduces the burden by implementing an easy to use Emoji picker in the block toolbar.
