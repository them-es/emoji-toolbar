A simple Emoji picker that integrates in the rich-text block toolbar.

== Description ==
Accessing the Emoji library can be painful üò´ on some operating systems. You always have to leave the editor which is not useful for distraction-free writing.
This plugin reduces the burden by implementing an easy to use Emoji picker in the block toolbar.

__Emoji Netiquette:__ Emojis have become popular culture and are here to stay but choose them wisely and avoid ‚ùóÔ∏è excessive use in your (business) communication.

The Emoji Mart library (BSD 3-Clause "New" or "Revised" License) has been developed by Missive.
